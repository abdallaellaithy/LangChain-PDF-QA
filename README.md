# LangChain-PDF-QA

LangChain-PDF-QA is a Python-based project that uses the LangChain framework to generate questions and answers from PDF documents. Itâ€™s designed to help programmers and students prepare for coding exams by creating practice questions based on the content of coding materials.

## Features

- **PDF Processing**: Extracts text from PDF files.
- **Question Generation**: Generates relevant questions from the extracted text to help in exam preparation.
- **Answer Generation**: Uses embeddings and vector stores to provide answers to the generated questions.
- **Output to CSV**: Saves the generated questions and answers into a CSV file.

## Installation

To get started, clone the repository and install the necessary dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/LangChain-PDF-QA.git
```
## Usage

Alternatively, you can directly install the required packages using the following command:

```bash
pip install langchain langchain_community PyPDF2 pypdf ctransformers sentence_transformers faiss-gpu
```
## Usage Steps

1. **Place your PDF file** in the project directory.

2. **Modify the `file_path` variable** in the script to point to your PDF file.

3. **Run the script to generate questions and answers:**

    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

   The generated questions and answers will be saved in `QA.csv`.

## How It Works

1. **Load PDF**: The `PyPDFLoader` extracts content from the provided PDF file.

2. **Text Splitting**: The content is split into manageable chunks using `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter`.

3. **Question Generation**: The extracted text is passed through a Language Model to generate practice questions.

4. **Answer Retrieval**: A FAISS vector store is used to retrieve and generate answers from the extracted content.

5. **Save to CSV**: The generated questions and answers are saved in a CSV file for easy access.

## Example

```python
file_path = "./PDF_PATH.pdf"  # Replace with your PDF file path
generate_questions_and_answers(file_path)
```
